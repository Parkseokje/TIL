# Why should learn go?

## Why you need a new language

- Hardware limitations
  (Problems such as limit of clock speed, heat generation, and increase in manufacturing cost)
- Lack of software to properly perform hardware performance
- Speed ​​up compiling dependencies
- Easy to modularize
- Shorter compile time to reduce feedback time for unit tests
- C/C ++ takes a lot of effort to write programs that can be executed in parallel.

## How go solves these problems

- Go is basically a statically type language, but it also has the characteristics of a dynamic type language
- Error occurrence can be verified in advance
- Pointer is provided, but not pointer operation
- Developers don't have to worry about disabling memory
- Go supports concurrency through goroutine and channel
  (concurrency: performing more than one task simultaneously)
- Go introduced the concept of supporting multicore at the design stage.
